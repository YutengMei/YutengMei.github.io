<h2>1. Lathe Introduction and Safety</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q-yXx55mwrmt6_tKPmrwYlV8GqNoNNRa/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Hello. This tutorial is meant to provide you
    with basic instruction on the six CNC lathes that we have here in the shop. If
    your component is cylindrically symmetric, a lathe is probably the machine that
    you will use to manufacture it.</p>

<p>The safety rules for the rest of the shop
    apply to the lathes as well.</p>

<p>1. Always wear safety glasses and a hat when
    operating any machinery in the shop.</p>

<p>2. However there are a few additional
    precautions that need to be taken when operating a lathe. First, make sure
    there are no loose items on your body that can get caught in the machine this
    includes items like watches bracelets necklaces and especially hair </p>

<p>3. The lathe will be spinning very fast during
    manufacturing and there are several protrusions on the lathe which can catch on
    hair and clothing. Never reach or lean into the work area when the machine is
    running.</p>

<p>4. In addition loading and unloading parts in
    the Chuck requires using a small square wrench to tighten the jaws. Never under
    any circumstances leave this wrench in the Chuck, not even for a moment. If the
    lane has accidentally started while the wrench is in the Chuck, the wrench will
    be flung out of the machine and could cause serious injury. </p>

<p>These are just some of the main safety
    concerns with the lathe there are others. Before using the lathe on your own,
    you will need to be trained by one of the shop staff.</p>

<h2>2. Main Lathe Features</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHgYYpeR5K5eisdGgXx3MwMpbn-xiD0Y/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>There are three main features located inside
    the lathes workspace:</p>

<p>1. The chuck</p>

<p>2. The carriage</p>

<p>3. And the tailstock</p>

<p>The Chuck is used to hold the components in
    place during manufacturing.</p>

<p>The carriage pulls a single point tool and is
    moved around the component to achieve the desired shape.</p>

<p>Lastly, the tailstock is used for drilling
    holes in the center of the part and for stabilizing long thin parts during
    machining.</p>

<h2>3. Digital Readout</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZF2dHnq0NpgBNq0NZqUyYM3SWh4oEMje/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>The control panel for the lathe has six
    options, which can be accessed by pressing the mode button:</p>

<p>1. digital readout or DRO</p>

<p>2. program</p>

<p>3. edit</p>

<p>4. setup</p>

<p>5. run</p>

<p>6. and program in out</p>

<p>For basic operation, the only mode you will
    need is DRO. The last five functions are used for programming the CNC functions
    of the lathe and will be covered in later tutorials.</p>

<p>In DRO mode, the carriage can be moved with
    the control wheels on the front of the lathe. The left wheel controls the axial
    motion the z-axis, while the right wheel controls the radial motion the x-axis.
    Note that the value of the x position is always given as a diameter, not at a
    radius, so for every inch the carriage moves in the X direction, the value of
    the x-position will change by two inches. This might seem counterintuitive, but
    since the diameter is much easier to measure than a radius, it will make the
    manufacturing process much easier.</p>

<p>The carriage can also be moved rapidly with a
    jog handle between the wheels, but be careful not to run the tool into the
    Chuck while jogging, and never jog when the tool is in contact with the work
    piece.</p>

<h2>4. Turning on Spindle</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XJ0k4MLwRJvKNz54EUKnh9AzjP2tWtzI/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>To turn the spindle on, press the forward
    button on the spindle control. The speed can be </p>

<p>controlled with the spindle speed button.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Press the "FWD" button on the control to turn
    on the spindle.</p>

<p>Press the "OFF" button on the control to turn
    off the spindle.</p>

<h2>5. Constant RPM</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SmuPAJPo4dQPUxLYRslcIwyyc7k5JbUD/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>There are two ways to specify the spindle
    speed. Pressing &quot;INC SET&quot; will specify a constant RPM and pressing
    &quot;ABS SET&quot; will specify a constant SFM. Constant RPM will spin the
    spindle at a constant number of revolutions per minute no matter where the tool
    is.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Select "SPIN SPEED" using the button below the
    control screen to set RPM.</p>

<p>Enter "500" as the value using the numeric
    keypad.</p>

<p>Press the "INC SET" button to set constant
    RPM.</p>

<h2>6. Constant SFM</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jnq_N92G--HP1bjzjdfzLLCaSHbjOfe3/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Constant SFM will adjust the RPM of the
    spindle depending on the tools radial position to maintain a constant linear
    velocity of the tool relative to the surface of the material. This puts less
    stress on the tool and leaves a nicer finish.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Select "Spin Speed" using the button below the
    control screen to set RPM</p>

<p>Enter "250" as the value using the numeric
    keypad.</p>

<p>Press the "ABS SET" button to set constant
    SFM.</p>

<h2>7. Fine/Coarse Feed Options</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10MDHe6ZNo-oa9aeP8XWQec9a2LAXoJRV/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>You can also adjust the speed of the carriage
    moves with a fine and coarse speed button. When the core speed option is
    selected, every turn of the handle will adjust the position by 0.8 inches.
    Selecting fine feed will reduce the feed to point to 0.2 inches.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Switch the lathe from fine to coarse control
    by selecting "C" on the keypad.</p>

<p>Switch the lathe back from coarse to fine
    control by selecting "F" on the keypad.</p>

<h2>8. Goto</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fdcB7Q7nfVFgnMmRiMPyPNK9acDC8Gq0/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>In DRO mode, there are some options to assist
    manual machining. The go-to lets you move rapidly from one position to another.
    Set the position by entering go to load, selecting the coordinate of interest,
    entering the desired value, and pressing &quot;ABS SET.&quot; Now when the
    wheel or jog handle is engaged the carriage will move up to but not beyond the
    set positions. Exiting out of this mode will negate this feature.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Select "GO TO" using the button below the
    control screen.</p>

<p>Select the "X" button to indicate that the go
    to coordinate will be in the x-direction.</p>

<p>Enter "3" as the desired x-value.</p>

<p>Select "ABS SET" to set the go to value.</p>

<p>Exit "GO TO" mode by selecting "RETURN" using
    the button below the control screen.</p>

<h2>9. Do one</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hsq86aOGg1iudqzyXNDVVQl6JtBGRhrB/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Do one allows features like tapered angles and
    corner radii to be machined. When one of the do one options is selected and
    specified the Z&amp;X wheels are disabled and instead made to control the
    coarse and fine feed of the path specified by the do one feature.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Press the "FWD" button on the control to turn
    on the spindle.</p>

<p>Select "DO ONE" using the button below the
    control screen.</p>

<p>Select "TAPER" using the button below the
    control screen.</p>

<p>Select "ABS SET" to execute the "DO ONE"
    feature.</p>

<p>Exit "DO ONE" mode by selecting "RETURN" using
    the button below the control screen.</p>

<p>Press the "OFF" button on the control to turn
    off the spindle.</p>

<h2>10. Power feed</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tWIUTssDx2n-iAmm5j608SQRxRY96Ii6/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Power feed can be used to move the carriage at
    a constant rate in one direction. The direction and distance of motion is
    specified with the inc key while the speed can be set in inches per minute or
    inches per revolution with the feed speed arrows. Note that the machine door
    must be closed to engage the power feed, as it must be during any operation
    where the carriage will be moved under computer control.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Press the "FWD" button on the control to turn
    on the spindle.</p>

<p>Select "POWER FEED" using the button below the
    control screen.</p>

<p>Select the "Z" button to indicate that the
    power feed will be in the z-direction.</p>

<p>Enter "-1" as the value for the power feed
    (use the "+/-" button to enter a negative value).</p>

<p>Select "ABS SET" to set the power feed.</p>

<p>Press the "OFF" button on the control to turn
    off the spindle.</p>

<h2>11. Return home</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zP_OjZrycEvLBUMsyqBJ3aP8Rr2RzORD/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Go home returns the machine to the home
    position, which can be set in the setup menu. Again, the machine door must be
    closed in order for this feature to function.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Select "RETURN HOME" using the button below
    the control screen.</p>

<p>Select "GO" under feed to return the tool to
    the home position.</p>

<h2>12. Tool number</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSntmr1vDUYpFi8cDyWbpc2DSOLgIKiw/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Tool number allows you to switch between the
    various tools that you have programmed into the tool table. Since each tool has
    a different size you will have different x and z values for a given carriage
    position.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<strong>Your turn. On the console to the right:</strong>

<p>Select "TOOL" using the button below the
    control screen.</p>

<p>Select tool 1 by entering "1" on the keypad.</p>

<p>Select "ABS SET" to enter the tool.</p>

<h2>13. Chuck</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNr31I9RFK3Ch8rOG_SIuMF6Ggi9QyJk/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>To load a component in the machine open the
    jaws with the Chuck wrench and place the component in the Chuck. Then tighten
    the jaws about the part. If you are working with a small diameter component,
    you can use a collet to secure the part instead. Collets are available in
    standard sizes up to one inch in the drawers next to each lathe.</p>

<p>To load a collet align the groove in the
    collet threads with the alignment screw in the Chuck. Then while applying
    pressure to the collet, tighten the wrench until the threads catch. Insert your
    part into the collet and then tighten the Chuck until the collet is secure.</p>

<h2>14. X Zero Demo</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vP4tao9LjsF_8KSq-y5N5Iv5cLZq4cRu/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>A quick way to zero the tool in either
    direction is to bring the tool near the part and then use a piece of paper to
    detect when the tool comes in contact. You can then set the X or Z position by
    pressing X or Z and entering the known value. This is a useful technique
    because it does not require any material to be removed from the part. However,
    if a truly accurate position is required, you will need to make a new cut in
    the component and measure its true dimensions.</p>

<p>To do this turn the machine on and remove a
    small amount of material. Then back the tool off the part without changing the
    dimensions you were trying to measure. Turn the spindle off and measure the
    true size of the cut which you have just made with a pair of micrometers. Enter
    the measured value of the new cut into the computer.</p>

<h2>15. End</h2>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1V_azN_2QspTQOpdeY2PmlUX2QXsQ1h/preview" width="640" height="360"></iframe>

<p>Once you have zeroed your tool, you can use
    the control wheels, power feed, and the do one feature to machine a wide
    variety of shapes. For complicated shapes, however, it'll be easier to program
    the machine to run a cycle.</p>
